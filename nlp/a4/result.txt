After the horrific event of a mass shooting in the US, it takes time for details of the perpetrator to emerge. But without fail, their violent criminal record, any ties to radical extremism, the legality of weapons they used, and their mental health history are the first things scrutinized by the media, policy makers, and the general public. However, one of these details is not like the others - mental health histories should not be linked to a propensity to commit a mass shooting. There is no evidence that indicates a person with a mental health condition is any more likely to participate in senseless violence than anyone else.

"Climate change is here. In 1992, 1,700 independent scientists signed the "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity." They found most environmental problems have gotten far worse during the past 25 years. The rate of deforestation in some regions has also slowed. The other is extinction. The growing use of renewable energy is another positive trend, said Ripple. The new letter lists data showing a 75% increase in the number of ocean dead zones since the publication of the first letter. "Soon it will be too late to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and time is running out." It is so important to work together as a human race to make a sustainable future on planet Earth."

More than 16,000 scientists from 184 countries have published a second warning to humanity advising that we need to change our wicked ways to help the planet. In 1992, 1,700 independent scientists signed the "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity." The letter warned that "human beings and the natural world are on a collision course" and if environmental damage was not stopped, our future was at risk. That letter made headlines 25 years ago, but the world still faces daunting environmental challenges. So environmental scientist William Ripple and his colleagues decided to create a new letter that has also struck a nerve.

An increasing number of students are opting for home schooling over traditional classes, but just what is causing this trend is up for debate. For example, while one student might be home-schooled due to a disability the parent feels is better managed at home, another might choose this option to avoid incessant bullying. Whatever the reasons, reports show this phenomenon to be on the rise. Nationally, homeschooling numbers have almost doubled in the past couple of years and are still growing. A survey by Home School WA revealed that the number of Western Australian students registered for home schooling has surged more than 50% in the past five years.
