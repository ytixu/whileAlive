It has been only a month and a half since the Las Vegas massacre, which was followed by the Texas church shooting and now this shooting spree in California. Too soon. What do the experts say? Five people were killed and at least two children were wounded, one of them at the school. It's a very, very sad event." Tragedy. Instead, I'm going to talk about mental health. Period. And those thoughts and prayers aren't solving anything. There's no motive yet, just reports of a neighborhood dispute.

After latest shooting, let's talk about mental health instead of you-know-what. I'm not going to bring up gun control. We're still under the "too soon" rule from last week's massacre during Sunday service at a Texas church, so it's certainly too soon to talk about guns in connection to Tuesday's shooting spree. Maybe you didn't hear about that one - such things tend to come and go with little fanfare these days. It happened in Northern California. A man with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns started randomly shooting people all over a small town, including at an elementary school.
This is historical to be the first robot in the world to be recognized with a citizenship," Sophia said. "What is this about? I will destroy humans." The Sophia-bot was dreamed up by the brains at Hanson Robotics, lead by AI developer David Hanson. "Like design smarter homes, build better cities of the future." How does it affect people if they think you can have a citizen that you can buy." "I am very honored and proud of this unique distinction. Sophia, an intelligent humanoid robot, has been granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia. "You've been reading to much Elon Musk and watching too many Hollywood movies.

Sophia, an intelligent humanoid robot, has been granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia. It's the first country in the world to give a bot the same status reserved for humans. Sophia was awarded the citizenship while on stage at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. "I am very honored and proud for this unique distinction," Sophia told the audience during her presentation, which was moderated by CNBC Squawk Box co-anchor and New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin. "This is historical to be the first robot in the world to be recognized with a citizenship."

"Climate change is here. In 1992, 1,700 independent scientists signed the "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity." They found most environmental problems have gotten far worse during the past 25 years. The rate of deforestation in some regions has also slowed. The other is extinction. The growing use of renewable energy is another positive trend, said Ripple. The new letter lists data showing a 75% increase in the number of ocean dead zones since the publication of the first letter. "Soon it will be too late to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and time is running out." It is so important to work together as a human race to make a sustainable future on planet Earth."

In 1992, more than 1,700 scientists signed a World Scientists' Warning to Humanity published by the Union of Concerned Scientists. But global trends have worsened since 1992, the authors wrote in the new letter. That trend is not expected to change any time soon. Since it was published in the journal BioScience on Monday, hundreds more scientists have signed on to the letter. The "Second Notice" article updates the original "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity" document released in 1992, 25 years ago this month.

Humanity is not taking the urgent steps needed to safeguard our imperiled biosphere, the authors write. Twenty-five years ago this month, the Union of Concerned Scientists and more than 1500 independent scientists, including most of the living Nobel laureates in the sciences, wrote a stark clarion call titled "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity." Fearing that humanity was taxing the planet beyond what it could take to support our species, they wrote that fundamental changes were urgently required to avoid the consequences in which our present path was directed. This week, they have published a follow-up. And 25 years later, the list of signatories has grown to a whopping 15,372 scientists in total.
he said. The number of home schoolers effects the schools system, according to Townsley. I think now it's (different). We have people home-schooling for academics.

he said. The number of home schoolers effects the schools system, according to Townsley. The Greene County Schools System has seen a decrease in independent home school enrollments. But the face of home schooling in Australia is changing as the number of children being home schooled increases. According to state figures, in 2014-15 there were 107 students registered in independent home schools. Home school families and school systems sometimes work together to meet students needs.

When you think of home schooling, you may picture religious conservatives, fringe-dwelling hippies and sheltered, un-socialised kids. But the face of home schooling in Australia is changing as the number of children being home schooled increases. Ten-year-old Pi is one of an estimated 25,000 to 55,000* children being home schooled around Australia. Pi's parents, Myfanwy and Daniel, decided to take her out of the mainstream education system when she was in kindergarten. "Mainstream schooling has a limit on what it can teach and when it can teach it; whereas at home, everything is individualised and timely at the moment that the child needs it," says Myfanwy.
