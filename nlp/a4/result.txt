This is historical to be the first robot in the world to be recognized with a citizenship," Sophia said. "What is this about? I will destroy humans." The Sophia-bot was dreamed up by the brains at Hanson Robotics, lead by AI developer David Hanson. "Like design smarter homes, build better cities of the future." How does it affect people if they think you can have a citizen that you can buy." "I am very honored and proud of this unique distinction. Sophia, an intelligent humanoid robot, has been granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia. "You've been reading to much Elon Musk and watching too many Hollywood movies.

"Climate change is here. In 1992, 1,700 independent scientists signed the "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity." They found most environmental problems have gotten far worse during the past 25 years. The rate of deforestation in some regions has also slowed. The other is extinction. The growing use of renewable energy is another positive trend, said Ripple. The new letter lists data showing a 75% increase in the number of ocean dead zones since the publication of the first letter.

More than 15,000 scientists from 184 countries warn the evidence is clear: Current and future human health and wellbeing are at serious risk from climate change, deforestation, loss of access to freshwater, species extinctions, and human population growth. Eminent scientists Jane Goodall, E.O. Wilson, and James Hansen are among those who have cosigned the warning, published Monday in the journal BioScience. The article, titled "World Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice," has 15,372 signatories in total, from a range of scientific disciplines. It is thought to be the largest-ever formal support by scientists for a journal article.

An increasing number of students are opting for home schooling over traditional classes, but just what is causing this trend is up for debate. For example, while one student might be home-schooled due to a disability the parent feels is better managed at home, another might choose this option to avoid incessant bullying. Whatever the reasons, reports show this phenomenon to be on the rise. Nationally, homeschooling numbers have almost doubled in the past couple of years and are still growing. A survey by Home School WA revealed that the number of Western Australian students registered for home schooling has surged more than 50% in the past five years.
